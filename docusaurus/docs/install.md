# Installation Guide

## API
The API can be installed simply using `pip` or `python` using:
- `pip install -e .`
- `python setup.py install`

This will install the Frater API to Python `site-packages`. You can also add Frater to your imports by adding 
the path to the repository to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
